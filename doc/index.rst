A poor man and/or hipster's TUI screenwriting software.

Introduction
============

Ever since the wide adoption of portable PCs screenwriters have been wondering
how they can set themselves even more apart from everyone else than just doing
their work in a local coffee shop on an expensive MacBook for everyone to see
instead of in an office on a reasonably priced computer like normal people
because nobody cares.

Now maximum apartness can be achieved: Write your screenplay in a terminal just
like in the olden days! Don't click around with your mouse. What's a mouse wheel
anyway? Feel the comfort of a fully ASCII-rendered user interface!

After all, screenplays are just text, why shouldn't screenwriting software be?
